            <h1>Project 1</h1>
            <p>Objective of this project is to design a portable, weatherproof case for a soil moisture sensor circuit.In this project, we will give you a design for a simple soil moisture sensor circuit that you can build on a breadboard. The circuit will have two probes that you insert into soil. It will turn on a small light (called a light-emitting diode (LED)) if the soil is too dry, and the light will stay off if the soil is wet . Then, when the light is on, you will know it is time to water your plants or lawn.However, the circuit by itself is not very portable or durable. It has loose wires that can easily come apart if you do not handle it gently, and it is not waterproof at all</p>
